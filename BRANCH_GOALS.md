# To-Do
## Go Scripts
- [ ] convert nifti files to VDBs natively
    - [ ] Eliminate NIfTI Dependency
    - [ ] write custom VDB script
    - Will include:
        - nifti.go
        - vdb.go

- [ ] **Should the following work off an intermediate (possibly sparse) tensor format or directly on the VDB?**
- [ ] Bold processing script
    - bold.go
- [ ] Generate audio from BOLD response
    - audio.go
## Python/Blender
- [ ] Integrate into Blender plugin

# Later
More advanced fMRI and MRI processing: combine grids, skull-stripping, directly edit VDBs, etc
