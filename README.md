# FMRI Testing
**Please see the main branch for a working version of this project.**
This branch is for the development of animated FMRI usage. It is a work in progress. Many commits will contain local paths, messy code, broken functions, etc.

# Issues
It appears that the blender binaries sometimes cause problems with git. This will be a non issue once we move the VDB implementation into a docker container. However, please remember to save a copy of any blender scripting in `src/blender_scripts`
